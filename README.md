# Basic Calculator code in Javascript

This is a beginner's basic Javascript program that does simple arithmetic operations.

I have parsed user input as float to accommodate both integers and floats especially when doing division.

You will also be alerted when you use an operator which is not valid.

When launch the page,you will be prompted to enter the first number:

On clicking ok button,you will be asked for the second number:

Thirdly,you get to key the operator sign:

Lastly,if you key in valid first,second numbers and operation sign,you get result of the arithmetic operation you initiated as shown below:
